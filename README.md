# Pre-work - *Tipsy*

**Tipsy** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Caleb Ripley**

Time spent: **10+** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Added Feelin' Tipsy button, for tipping big when you're really feelin' it!

## Notes

The biggest challenge was trying to push my code from x code to my git repo. With x code 7, it can't push if you create 
a repo with a README or .gitignore. You must create them after you push your project to the repo. Also, when I tried to commit
a second time I encountered all of the same errors and could only get around them by creating a new repo. Constraints in xcode
as well as getting the color I am looking for was also quite a challenge!
